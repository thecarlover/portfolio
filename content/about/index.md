# About Me

Hello, I'm Ojasvi Mittal, a resident of the enchanting city of Kashipur in the scenic state of Uttarakhand. Nestled near Haldwani, Kashipur offers a picturesque landscape that inspires me every day with its natural beauty and tranquil ambiance.

I completed my schooling at the esteemed Maria Assumption Convent in Kashipur, where I developed a strong foundation in education and values. Currently, I am pursuing my technical studies at the Graphic Era Hill University (GEHU) in Dehradun, a vibrant city known for its academic excellence and dynamic environment.

Beyond academics, I have a passion for exploring new hobbies and interests. Whether it's immersing myself in the latest tech trends, delving into creative projects, or enjoying the serene beauty of my surroundings, I strive to maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.

My journey is fueled by a love for learning and a curiosity to discover the world around me, all while staying connected to my roots in the breathtaking region of Uttarakhand.

I see a fascinating blend of technical prowess and creative flair within me. My passion for development, coding, and tinkering with electronic components showcases my analytical mind and innovative spirit.

Whether I'm crafting web applications or diving into Android development, I'm constantly pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons in the digital realm. Amidst my tech-driven pursuits,

my love for the guitar adds a harmonious touch, revealing my appreciation for artistic expression. My unique fascination with cars adds another layer to my multifaceted persona, reflecting an appreciation for design, engineering, and the thrill of the open road. In my journey through the realms of technology and music, I seamlessly blend precision with passion, creating a dynamic narrative of ingenuity and creativity.
